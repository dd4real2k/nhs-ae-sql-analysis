## NHS A&E Performance Analysis & Forecasting
End-to-end data project analysing NHS A&E performance (2020–2026), combining SQL analytics, machine learning, and deployment (FastAPI + Streamlit) to model and forecast healthcare demand.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Analyse real-world healthcare data at scale using SQL and Python
- Identify operational pressure points in NHS A&E services
- Build and evaluate forecasting models for demand prediction
- Deploy data solutions using FastAPI and Streamlit
- Structure a production-style data project end-to-end

## Project Summary

This project analyses NHS A&E (Accident & Emergency) performance data using multi-year provider-level datasets from **April 2020 to February 2026**.

It combines **data engineering, SQL analytics, and machine learning** to explore demand patterns, waiting-time pressures, and forecast future A&E attendances.

The project demonstrates how healthcare data can be used to support operational planning and decision-making.

## Key Insights

- High-demand trusts consistently experience higher 4-hour breaches
- Significant variation exists in 12+ hour delays across organisations
- Clear seasonal patterns show increased pressure during winter months
- A small number of NHS organisations handle disproportionately high patient volumes (top 10 account for ~65% of total demand)
- A&E demand is strongly driven by recent trends and recurring patterns

## Business Problem
NHS A&E departments face increasing operational pressure due to:

- Rising patient demand
- Long waiting times
- Resource and capacity constraints

This project investigates these challenges using historical data and extends the analysis into **predictive modelling** to support forward planning and better resource allocation.

## Key Questions Answered
- Which organisations handle the highest A&E demand?
- Which trusts experience the worst 4-hour performance?
- Where are long (12+ hour) delays most prevalent?
- How does performance vary across regions?
- Can future A&E demand be predicted using historical data?

## Approach
- Combined multiple NHS monthly datasets (2020–2026) into a unified dataset
- Cleaned and standardised data across years
- Engineered key performance metrics
- Built SQL queries to analyse demand and waiting-time performance
- Developed time-series features for forecasting
- Trained and compared multiple machine learning models

## SQL Analysis

This folder contains SQL queries used for the NHS A&E analysis project.

- `01_national_summary.sql` — national totals and validation
- `02_top_attendance_orgs.sql` — busiest organisations
- `03_over4_waits.sql` — 4-hour breach analysis
- `04_long_waits.sql` — 12+ hour delays
- `05_regional_summary.sql` — regional comparison
- `06_rankings.sql` — pressure ranking across organisations


## Predictive Modelling
Multiple models were developed to forecast A&E demand:

- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LSTM (deep learning)

## Best Model
XGBoost achieved the strongest performance across all evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in capturing non-linear patterns in A&E demand compared to baseline and alternative models.

## Model Performance
| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|------|-----:|------:|----:|
| XGBoost | 416.17 | 701.70 | 0.9945 |
| Random Forest | 414.32 | 720.91 | 0.9942 |
| Linear Regression | 530.18 | 802.00 | 0.9928 |
| LSTM | 528.64 | 838.55 | 0.9921 |

## Features Used
- Lag features (1, 3, 6, 12 months)
- Rolling averages and variability
- Seasonal encoding (month cyclic features)
- Operational indicators (admissions, wait times, booked attendances)

## Key Modelling Insight
A&E demand is primarily driven by:
- Recent historical activity (lag features)
- Short-term trends (rolling averages)
- Seasonal patterns (monthly cycles)

## Application Layer
This project includes:

- **FastAPI backend** for serving predictions
- **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive analysis and forecasting

This transforms the project from static analysis into a deployable, end-to-end data application.

This architecture reflects a simplified production setup, where models are served via an API and consumed by a frontend application.
