# NHS A&E Performance Analysis and Demand Forecasting (2020-2026)

## Overview
This project analyses NHS A&E (Accident & Emergency) performance data using multi-year provider-level datasets from **April 2020 to February 2026**.

It combines **data engineering, SQL analysis, and machine learning** to explore demand patterns, waiting-time pressures, and forecast future A&E attendances.

## Project Highlights
- Analysed NHS A&E provider-level data from April 2020 to February 2026
- Built SQL queries to investigate demand and waiting-time performance
- Developed and compared multiple forecasting models
- Extended the project with a FastAPI backend and Streamlit dashboard

## Business Problem
NHS A&E departments face increasing operational pressure due to:

- Rising patient demand
- Long waiting times
- Resource and capacity constraints

This project investigates these challenges using historical data and extends the analysis into **predictive modelling** to support better planning and decision-making.

## Key Questions Answered
- Which organisations handle the highest A&E demand?
- Which trusts experience the worst 4-hour performance?
- Where are long (12+ hour) delays most prevalent?
- How does performance vary across regions?
- Can future A&E demand be predicted using historical data?

## Key Insights
- A small number of organisations handle disproportionately high patient volumes
- High-demand trusts often also experience higher 4-hour breaches
- Significant variation exists in 12+ hour waits across organisations
- Regional differences highlight uneven healthcare pressure distribution
- A&E demand shows strong dependence on recent historical trends and seasonality

## Approach
- Combined multiple NHS monthly datasets (2020–2026) into a unified dataset
- Cleaned and standardised data across years
- Engineered key performance metrics
- Built SQL queries to analyse demand and waiting-time performance
- Developed time-series features for forecasting
- Trained and compared multiple machine learning models

# SQL Queries

This folder contains SQL queries used for the NHS A&E analysis project.

- `01_national_summary.sql` — national totals and row count
- `02_top_attendance_orgs.sql` — busiest organisations by attendance
- `03_over4_waits.sql` — worst over-4-hour wait pressure
- `04_long_waits.sql` — longest 12+ hour waits
- `05_regional_summary.sql` — regional/parent organisation comparison
- `06_rankings.sql` — pressure bands and ranking queries

## Predictive Modelling

Multiple models were developed to forecast A&E demand:

- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LSTM (deep learning)

## Best Model Summary
Among the models tested, XGBoost achieved the strongest forecasting performance based on RMSE and R², showing better ability to capture non-linear demand patterns than the baseline and tree-based alternatives.

## Features Used
- Lag features (1, 3, 6, 12 months)
- Rolling averages and variability
- Seasonal encoding (month cyclic features)
- Operational indicators (admissions, wait times, booked attendances)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

Models were compared to identify the best-performing approach for forecasting NHS A&E demand.

## Model Performance

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|------|-----:|------:|----:|
| XGBoost | 416.17 | 701.70 | 0.9945 |
| Random Forest | 414.32 | 720.91 | 0.9942 |
| Linear Regression | 530.18 | 802.00 | 0.9928 |
| LSTM | 528.64 | 838.55 | 0.9921 |

## Feature Importance Insights

The model relies most heavily on:

- Recent attendances (lag features)
- Rolling averages (short-term trends)
- Seasonal signals (monthly patterns)

This indicates that A&E demand is driven by **recent activity and recurring seasonal behaviour**

## App and API Layer

This project also includes:

- **FastAPI backend** for serving model predictions
- **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive analysis, forecasting, and model comparison

This extends the project from notebook-based analysis to an interactive data application.
